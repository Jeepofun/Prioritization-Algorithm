# Prioritization-Algorithm
An algorithm that prioritizes data features using Shapely values
The IV Features try to predict a DV, in this case a DEI score.  The shapely values prioritize the focus of IVs to maximize the DEI score.  The current IVs are based in BS, but could be swapped for a different set of IVs.
